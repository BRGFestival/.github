# BR Game Festival

Welcome to the [**BR Game Festival**!](https://brfestival.com.br) This is a digital platform celebrating the talent and creativity of Brazil's indie gaming market. Created with the goal of supporting and promoting independent studios, our platform offers a dedicated space where developers can showcase their games to the public and direct them to stores where they are available.

## About the Project

The BR Game Festival is the result of a partnership between [**SoftYes TI**](https://softyes.com.br) and [**BRBOX**](https://brboxes.com.br), companies committed to the growth of the gaming market in Brazil. This platform was conceived as a digital festival to bring together the best national indie titles, creating a showcase where partner studios can present their projects, engage new players, and connect with opportunities in the industry.

## Partnership Program

Our **Partnership Program** allows game studios to:

- **Promote** their titles to a target audience interested in Brazilian indie games.
- **Submit their games** for inclusion on the platform, with direct links to official stores, such as Steam, itch.io, and others.
- **Gain visibility** through campaigns and featured spots on our homepage during the festival and seasonal events.

## How to Join

Those interested in joining the BR Game Festival can reach out for information on the application process for the partnership program. We aim to build a strong community that values the work of Brazilian studios and expands the reach of indie games in the market!
